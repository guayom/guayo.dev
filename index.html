<h1>I'm Guayo</h1>
<h2>I have been building websites for the last 15 years.</h2>
<p>For the last 6 years my stack has been mainly <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Typescript</strong>,
    <strong>NestJS</strong>
    <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong>, <strong>AWS</strong> and some <strong>GCP</strong>. But
    currently I
    am more excited about the <strong>Django + htmx</strong> stack and minimal js frameworks like
    <strong>Alpine.js</strong>
</p>
<p>You can find more about my skills in <a href="/resume">my resume</a>.</p>

<p>This site looks pretty dull right now, but I made some interesting technical decisions. Check out my <a
        href="/blog/technical-decisions-made-for-this-website">blog post about that</a>.</p>
