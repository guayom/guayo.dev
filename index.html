<h1>I'm Guayo</h1>
<h2>Building websites for the last 15 years</h2>
<p>I help startups turn ideas into scalable, low-complexity software that grows with their business. As a problem
    solver, I focus on efficiency, maintainability, and impact. I wear many hats—from technical leadership to
    architecture—and have deep experience in building and scaling engineering teams in Costa Rica. As co-founder of the
    React community in Costa Rica, I'm well-connected in the local tech scene and always looking to collaborate.</p>
<p>For the last 6 years my stack has been mainly <strong>React, Typescript, NestJS, Node.js, GraphQL, AWS</strong> and
    some <strong>GCP</strong>. But currently I am more excited about the <strong>Django + htmx</strong> stack and
    minimal js frameworks like
    <strong>Alpine.js</strong>

<p>This site looks pretty dull right now, but I made some interesting technical decisions. Check out my <a
