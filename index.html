<h1>I'm Guayo</h1>
<h2>I have been building websites for the last 15 years.</h2>
<p>For the last 6 years my stack has been mainly <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Typescript</strong>,
    <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong>, <strong>AWS</strong> and some <strong>GCP</strong>. But
    currently I
    am more excited about the <strong>Django + htmx</strong> stack and minimal js frameworks like
    <strong>Alpine.js</strong>
</p>

<div x-data="{step: 0}">
    <blockquote x-show="step == 0">
        <p>"Why the dull website though?"</p>
        <cite>- Probably you right now</cite>
        <button x-on:click="step++">Gimme answers!</button>
    </blockquote>
    <div x-show="step >= 1" id="steps" x-bind:class="{ 'hidden': step < 1 }" class="hidden">
        <ul>
            <li x-show="step >= 1">Did you notice the smooth transitions between pages?<br />
                <span>No React or any bulky JS framework!</span>
            </li>
            <li x-show="step >= 2">Did you notice how fast it loads? Navigating feels immediate!</li>
            <li x-show="step >= 3">See how I'm managing and persisting state?</li>
            <li x-show="step >= 4">I'm using many of the latest css features!<br />
                <span>inspect my css! No sass, no tailwind, no css-in-js...</span>
            </li>
            <li x-show="step >= 5">Have a look at my markup, it's pretty semantic!</li>
        </ul>
        <p x-show="step >= 6">Anyway, it's not the flashiest site, but I'm expressing some of my <strong>strong
                opinions</strong> about how
            websites should be
            built.
            I wrote a full <a href="/blog/technical-decisions-made-for-this-website">article on all the decisions
                and compromises I made when I built this website</a>. I was very intentional about every decision, and
            that's just satisfying :)</p>
