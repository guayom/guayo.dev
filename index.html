<h1>I'm Guayo</h1>
<h2>A seasoned web developer with over 15 years of experience</h2>
<p>For the last 6 years my stack has been mainly <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Typescript</strong>,
    <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong>, <strong>AWS</strong> and some <strong>GCP</strong>. But
    currently I
    am more excited about the <strong>Django + htmx</strong> stack and minimal js frameworks like
    <strong>Alpine.js</strong>
</p>
<h2>You may be wondering</h2>
<p>But if you are such a good developer, why would you make such an <strong>ugly website?</strong></p>
<button>Explain now!</button>
<ul>
    <li>Did you notice the smooth transitions between pages?<br />
        <span>No React or any bulky JS framework!</span>
    </li>
    <li>Did you notice how fast it loads? Navigating feels immediate!</li>
    <li>See how I'm managing and persisting state?</li>
    <li>I'm using many of the latest css features!<br />
        <span>inspect my css! No sass, no tailwind, no css-in-js...</span>
    </li>
    <li>Have a look at my markup, it's pretty semantic!</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, it's not the flashiest site, but I'm expressing some of my <strong>strong opinions</strong> about how
    websites should be
    built. I wrote a full <a href="/blog/technical-decisions-made-for-this-website">article on all the decisions and
        compromises I made when I built this website</a>. I was very intentional about every decision, and that's just
    satisfying somehow :)</p>
