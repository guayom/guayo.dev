    <p>I help startups turn ideas into scalable, low-complexity software that grows with their business. As a problem
        solver, I focus on efficiency, maintainability, and impact. I wear many hats—from technical leadership to
        architecture—and have deep experience in building and scaling engineering teams in Costa Rica. As co-founder of
        the React community in Costa Rica, I'm well-connected in the local tech scene and always looking to collaborate.
